			<br>
			<br>Its body is covered in a dark body suit, 
			<br>with the chest and stomach exposed, and 
			<br>has pieces of padded armor over the 
			<br>shoulders, arms and wrists, knees and feet.

			<br>gray and blue.

		<h2 class="subtitle">Abilities:</h2>
		Sticky Fingers is a close-range Stand whose excellent strength and speed make it suitable for direct combat. In addition, it possesses a very versatile ability in the form of its zippers. 

		<h3 class="subtitle">Zippers:</h3>
		The main function of Sticky Fingers is creating zippers on what its fist touches, which it can remotely open or close at any time. It has various applications, such as using it to travel through walls or floors, detaching and attaching limbs, and storing objects inside something. The idea of a zipper stand comes from the Sticky Fingers album's cover.
		Sticky Fingers can create zippers that cut through the entirety of objects, allowing Bucciarati to dismantle them. With this ability, he can separate enemies into multiple pieces and even perform a cutting attack by detaching something and then canceling the zipper.

			Bucciarati has control over whether sectioning by zippers inflicts actual damage or not. Non damaging examples include when Bucciarati zipped his head in half to evade an attack, or when he detached Mario Zucchero's head, keeping it alive and conscious. Damaging examples include when Bucciarati split his heart in half to cease its beating, and when he sectioned Pesci in to numerous pieces, which was instantly fatal.
			
			Inversely, Bucciarati is free to attach several things together with his zippers. It allowed him to block King Crimson's arm when it impaled his chest or even attach another's arm to his body. It also enabled Abbacchio to heal his severed hand.

			<h2 class="subtitle">Curiosities:</h2>

			<li>Its ability is inspired by the cover of the Rolling Stones album Sticky Fingers, which featured a functional zipper on the record version.</li>
			<br>
			<li>The anime's website spells the name of the Stand as Sutikkī Fingāzu (スティッキー・フィンガーズ).</li>
			<br>
			<li>Sticky Fingers' stats received a slight boost in the anime adaptation, with its E in Range being upgraded to a C. This is reflected in the Stand's ability to extend its appendages via a long zipper.</li>
			<br>
			<li> Coincidently, Sticky Fingers' localized name, "Zipper Man", is shared with a song of the same name by American rock band, the Queen Annes.</li>
